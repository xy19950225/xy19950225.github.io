English README | [中文说明](README.zh-cn.md)

**LoveIt** is a **clean**, **elegant** but **advanced** blog theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

It is based on the original [LeaveIt Theme](https://github.com/liuzc/LeaveIt/) and [KeepIt Theme](https://github.com/liuzc/LeaveIt/).

Since the three themes have a similar look, if you have questions about their differences,
read [Why choose LoveIt](#why-choose-loveit) so that you can choose the one that works best for you.

## Why choose LoveIt

Compared to the original LeaveIt theme and the KeepIt theme, the LoveIt theme has the following modifications.

* Custom **Header**
* Custom **CSS Style**
* A new **home page**, compatible with the latest version of Hugo
* A lot of **style detail adjustments,** including color, font size, margins, code preview style
* More readable **dark mode**
* Some beautiful **CSS animations**
* Easy-to-use and self-expanding **table of contents**
* Extended markdown syntax for **[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons**
* Extended markdown syntax for **ruby annotation**
* **Mathematical formula** support by [KaTeX](https://katex.org/)
* **Diagram syntax** shortcode support by [mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid)
* **Interactive data visualization** shortcode supported by [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/)

the LoveIt theme may be more suitable for you.

I hope you will LoveIt ❤️!
